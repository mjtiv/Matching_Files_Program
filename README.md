# Program Overview
Program compares two Files to see if they match. Compares the files line
by line to see which lines match. The order of the lines does not quite matter because the program cycles through everything. Lines that are different in either file are reported back in the mis-match report file. All user has to do is change the "Matching_Files_Parameter_File.txt" to their files of interests and run the program locally
or in an HPC environment.
